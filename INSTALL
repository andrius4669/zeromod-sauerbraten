installation on unix-like systems:
to compile this mod on unix-like systems you may need to install additional packages.
this mod requires zlib library and headers, and optionally geoip library and headers (for geoip support)
on debian-like systems you may use:
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev libmaxminddb-dev build-essential
if changing sauer protocol version is needed, copy `src/config.mk.example` to `src/config.mk` and edit as needed.
to compile this mod on unix-like systems, use: `make -C src install_server`
or, if you want to build client too: `make -C src install`
for cleanup, use: `make -C src clean; make -C src/enet clean`
please be aware, that enet changes will not be detected by build system and thus need to be cleaned manually.
copy desired server-init.cfg example file to server-init.cfg and edit it as needed.
install_server installs server binary into bin_unix/ directory, feel free to copy (or symlink) this binary whether you need.
you can get list of server-init.cfg options/commands by changing to src directory and typing:
grep -E '^[:space:]*(COMMAND|ICOMMAND|VAR|SVAR)' engine/server.cpp fpsgame/server.cpp fpsgame/aiman.h fpsgame/ctf.h fpsgame/z_*
in case you want geoip support, read `README_geoip.txt`.
